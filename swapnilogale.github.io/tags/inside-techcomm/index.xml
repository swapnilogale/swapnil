      <description>I chatted with the host of Inside TechComm about:
 What does the technical communication landscape look like in Australia? What is a technical writer advocate? How did Swapnil perform his own tech comm retrospective to elevate his role and make it visible? What is the Amazon narrative, and how can someone use this narrative before starting a project? What are some strategies to raise the profile of a tech writer at a company and beyond?</description>
