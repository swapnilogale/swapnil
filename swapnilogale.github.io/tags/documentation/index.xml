      <title>What&#39;s the Deal with Release Notes?</title>
      <link>https://swapnilogale.github.io/publications/releasenotes/</link>

      <description>Product managers swear by them, development managers are keen on producing them and quite so often your developers or engineers will help (grudgingly) craft them.
Release notes are everywhere, be it a product or a process. They are quite often your first point of communication with customers eager to know whatâ€™s new or fixed in your product or process. In some instances, they also become the most frequently or commonly accessed content on your documentation site.</description>

      <description>Context Write the Docs is a global community of people who care about documentation. We consider everyone who cares about communication, documentation, and their users to be a member of our community. This can be programmers, tech writers, developer advocates, customer support, marketers, and anyone else who wants people to have great experiences with software.
Contribution While we have had other communities in Australia that covered technical documentation sporadically, there was no community for like minded people to get together and talk about documentation issues.</description>
