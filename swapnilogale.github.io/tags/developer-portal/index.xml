      <description>Context SEEK is currently refreshing its API integration products for partners and hirers.
Problem The various SEEK teams are working on a single API built using GraphQL, OAuth 2.0 and optional webhooks. The Partner Integration team is working on refreshing the onboarding experience for partners and hirers, to improve process efficiencies and streamline the self-serving nature of the process.
As part of this project, they required a Technical Writer to assist with redesigning the onboarding portal and review the developer portal content for consistency and accuracy.</description>

      <description>Context The role of Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) is to manage the electricity and gas systems and markets across Australia, helping to ensure Australians have access to affordable, secure and reliable energy.
I was part of AEMO&amp;rsquo;s distributed energy initiatives and a market trial project, working with multiple teams to document a range of content for different audiences.
Opportunity I was assigned to manage the entire suite of documentation, for two Australia-wide distributed energy initiatives documenting technical specifications, API design, user guides, and reference documentation.</description>
