      <description>I chatted with the host of Inside TechComm about:
 What does the technical communication landscape look like in Australia? What is a technical writer advocate? How did Swapnil perform his own tech comm retrospective to elevate his role and make it visible? What is the Amazon narrative, and how can someone use this narrative before starting a project? What are some strategies to raise the profile of a tech writer at a company and beyond?</description>

      <description>Context Write the Docs is a global community of people who care about documentation. We consider everyone who cares about communication, documentation, and their users to be a member of our community. This can be programmers, tech writers, developer advocates, customer support, marketers, and anyone else who wants people to have great experiences with software.
Contribution While we have had other communities in Australia that covered technical documentation sporadically, there was no community for like- minded people to get together and talk about documentation issues.</description>
