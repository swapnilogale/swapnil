      <description>In this talk, I question how to make our content sustainable, especially now when our content is growing at an unprecedented rate. Just when we thought we had a handle on user needs, that seems to be changing every minute. What does it really mean to create sustainable content and how do we achieve this?
 Docs and processes are a mess, but they don’t have to be. Reuse. Reduce. Recycle.</description>

      <description>Product managers swear by them, development managers are keen on producing them and quite so often your developers or engineers will help (grudgingly) craft them.
Release notes are everywhere, be it a product or a process. They are quite often your first point of communication with customers eager to know what’s new or fixed in your product or process. In some instances, they also become the most frequently or commonly accessed content on your documentation site.</description>

      <description>I was invited by Madcap Software to write a guest post for their blog. I wrote about a case study where I had to justify the use of single sourcing at the organisation I was working at the time.
To summarise how the single sourcing strategy worked at the organisation was:
 Avoided issues with duplication of content. All my content resided in one location, reducing inconsistencies. Set a consistent look and feel across all the documentation projects.</description>
