[{"categories":null,"contents":" Context SEEK is currently refreshing its API integration products for partners and hirers.\nProblem The various SEEK teams are working on a single API built using GraphQL, OAuth 2.0 and optional webhooks. The Partner Integration team is working on refreshing the onboarding experience for partners and hirers, to improve process efficiencies and streamline the self-serving nature of the process.\nAs part of this project, they required a Technical Writer to assist with redesigning the onboarding portal and review the developer portal content for consistency and accuracy. They also needed someone to refresh site taxonomy \u0026amp; information architecture.\nContribution I started with understanding the problem they were trying to solve, by talking to various stakeholders including the Partner Integration team, Product Managers and Developers across multiple product feature areas.\nSince the start of the project in Feb, I have:\n Completed a content audit of the existing onboarding and developer portals. Facilitated a card sorting exercise to identify key themes and groups. Created an Information Plan with mockups, content suggestions and a plan to create content. Initiated a style guide to capture key decisions around content styles. Reviewed 2 key use cases of the SEEK API and edited these to make them clear to understand. Created authentication topics for partners to understand how to authenticate for using the SEEK API. Written documentation for 2 use cases of the SEEK API.  Impact  Delivered technical content that helped partners understand how to integrate with API components. Set up a documentation roadmap, process and workflow that was used by 2 key development teams.

While they were developing their product, they needed a Technical Writer to create end user documentation that could be used by Training and Support teams.\nContribution Since 2015, I have worked remotely with Planifi on a part time basis to plan, create and deliver online help, user guides, Release Notes and other support documentation across four different projects.\nAs part of this, I have worked with the startup co-founder to understand user requirements and pivoted the documentation to fit user needs. For example, starting off with feature/functionality based documentation, I evolved the documentation to be more task based, and also incorporated interactivity with images in documentation.\n Analysed existing documentation and migrated content from RoboHelp to Madcap Flare. Scoped, planned and created documentation for 3 standalone desktop projects: Analyzer, Visualizer and Forecasting. Created Release Notes for users across multiple product version releases. Currently working on creating user assistance for their new product Visual Planning.  Impact  Collaborated with the startup since 2015, and documented over 4 different products, and 100+ topics. The technical documentation, release notes and videos have been reused across multiple channels, including support and training and customer feedback has been very positive.

I have been part of other groups that organised technical writing events and conferences in the past, but in 2016, none of these groups existed and there was a serious gap in community events.\nI initiated the Write the Docs community in Australia in June 2016 and started building meetup events around Australia, along with a lot of help from friends from my writing network.
