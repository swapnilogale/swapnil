I chatted with the host of Inside TechComm about:

- What does the technical communication landscape look like in Australia?
- What is a technical writer advocate?
- How did Swapnil perform his own tech comm retrospective to elevate his role and make it visible?
- What is the Amazon narrative, and how can someone use this narrative before starting a project?
- What are some strategies to raise the profile of a tech writer at a company and beyond?
