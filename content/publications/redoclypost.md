As part of my Technical Writer Advocate role at Redocly, I was often asked by other technical writers in the community about they could use Redocly for their API documentation.

I wrote about my experiences with Redocly, and how other technical writers could get started with Redocly products to create awesome API documentation. This article captures the workflow for technical writers wanting to get the best out of Redocly products.
