"You have your content moving at a swift pace, your documents are getting reviewed in a timely fashion (surprise!) and you are nicely heading towards your release milestone.

The only thing missing are some key screenshots that you need to put in before you publish your documentation. What you get instead are some hideous images posing as screenshots, that were captured randomly, bears no resemblance to your instructions and would make no sense whatsoever to the end user."  

We (documentarians) know how this usually pans out.

This talk was about when bad screenshots happen to good writers.

In my presentation, I spoke about:

- Why do we need screenshots and who provides these screenshots?
- What is the outcome of bad screenshots?
- Can we do something about acquiring screenshots in a standard manner?
- What are some best practices everyone can use for screenshots?
- Some examples of really useless screenshots.
