I was invited by [Madcap Software](https://www.madcapsoftware.com/) to write a guest post for their blog. I wrote about a case study where I had to justify the use of single sourcing at the organisation I was working at the time.

To summarise how the single sourcing strategy worked at the organisation was:

- Avoided issues with duplication of content. All my content resided in one location, reducing inconsistencies.
- Set a consistent look and feel across all the documentation projects.
- Was published for different audiences with different information requirements.
- Allowed me to adapt quickly to changing requirements or ad-hoc requests.
- Had complete control over content as well as output format and design.
