In this talk, I question how to make our content sustainable, especially now when our content is growing at an unprecedented rate. Just when we thought we had a handle on user needs, that seems to be changing every minute. What does it really mean to create sustainable content and how do we achieve this?

- Docs and processes are a mess, but they donâ€™t have to be.
- Reuse. Reduce. Recycle.
- Think content first.
