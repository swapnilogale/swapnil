I have over 14 years of technical writing experience, including 5 years of part-time remote freelance work, in:

- Scoping and creating technical content,
- Designing information architecture strategies,
- Leading documentation projects, and
- Managing technical writing teams.

For the last 3-4 years, I have been working with software and API developement teams, creating technical specifications, API documentation, and content for developer portals.

I initiated the [Write the Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/) community in Australia, and contributed to an open source project in the [Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/2019/participants) in 2019.

Since 2014, I have been adding to my professional equity through public speaking and have presented at technical documentation conferences in India, US, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.
