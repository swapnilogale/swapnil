I have over 17 years of technical writing experience, including 10 years of working remotely, in:

- Scoping and creating technical content,
- Designing information architecture strategies,
- Leading documentation projects, and
- Managing technical writing teams.

I am currently the first Technical Writer in the APJ (Asia Pacific and Japan) engineering teams at Amazon Web Services Australia.

Over the last 10 years, I have worked with software and API development teams, creating technical specifications, API documentation, content for developer portals, and implementation guides for bespoke solutions.
You can best describe me as "_A technical writer who appreciates the depth of technology and isn't afraid to dive deeper when needed._"

I initiated the [Write the Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/) community in Australia, contributed to an open source project in the [Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/2019/participants) in 2019, and managed Redocly's open source documentation project and mentored technical writers as part of [Google Season of Docs 2021](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/participants). I also actively mentor aspiring and transitioning technical writers through the [ADPList](https://adplist.org/mentors/swapnil-ogale) platform.

Since 2014, I have been adding to my public speaking skills by presenting at technical documentation conferences in India, US, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.
