Technical Writer with over 14+ years of experience (including remote work) in content design, information architecture, product content, and leading/managing documentation projects. I initiated the [Write the Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/) community in Australia, and contributed to an open source project in the Google Season of Docs in 2019.

Since 2014, I have been adding to my professional equity through public speaking and have presented at technical documentation conferences in India, US, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.

For the last 3-4 years, I have been working with software development teams, planning and creating technical content, API documentation and content for developer portals.
