I have over 16 years of technical writing experience, including 7 years of working remotely, in:

- Scoping and creating technical content,
- Designing information architecture strategies,
- Leading documentation projects, and
- Managing technical writing teams.

I am currently the first Technical Writer in the APJ (Asia Pacific and Japan) Solutions Engineering team at AWS Australia.

Over the last 5 years, I have worked with software and API development teams, creating technical specifications, API documentation, and content for developer portals.

I initiated the [Write the Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/) community in Australia, contributed to an open source project in the [Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/2019/participants) in 2019, and managed Redocly's open source documentation project and mentored technical writers as part of [Google Season of Docs 2021](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/participants).

Since 2014, I have been adding to my professional equity through public speaking and have presented at technical documentation conferences in India, US, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.
