### Context

The role of Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) is to manage the electricity and gas systems and markets across Australia, helping to ensure Australians have access to affordable, secure and reliable energy.

I was part of AEMO's distributed energy initiatives and a market trial project, working with multiple teams to document a range of content for different audiences.

### Opportunity
I was assigned to manage the entire suite of documentation, for two Australia-wide distributed energy initiatives documenting technical specifications, API design, user guides, and reference documentation.

- [Distributed Energy Resources Register (DERR)](https://www.aemo.com.au/energy-systems/electricity/der-register)
- [Virtual Power Plant (VPP)](https://www.aemo.com.au/initiatives/major-programs/nem-distributed-energy-resources-der-program/pilots-and-trials/virtual-power-plant-vpp-demonstrations)

### Contribution

Over the course of the two projects, I worked on:

- Planning, designing and writing project and product documentation for gas and electricity market applications.
- Collating and editing technical project information from IT, release management and business teams involved in system build, test, and deployment releases.
- Assisting developers with documenting user interfaces and the gas/electricity data models to help users replicate data between their systems and AEMOâ€™s systems.
- Creating API documentation for the AEMO Developer Portal.
