### Context
[Planifi](https://www.planifi.net/) helps lean organisations do more with less: increase productivity, decrease wasted resource hours, and deliver visibility into project performance across your entire firm.

### Problem
A niche startup, Planifi develops and delivers a suite of products to architecture and engineering firms to manage their projects, schedules, resources and forecasting. While they were developing their product, they needed a Technical Writer to create end user documentation that could be used by Training and Support teams.

### Contribution

Since 2015, I have worked remotely with Planifi on a part time basis to plan, create and deliver online help, user guides, Release Notes and other support documentation across four different projects.

As part of this, I have worked with the startup co-founder to understand user requirements and pivoted the documentation to fit user needs. For example, starting off with feature/functionality based documentation, I evolved the documentation to be more task based, and also incorporated interactivity with images in documentation.

- Analysed existing documentation and migrated content from RoboHelp to Madcap Flare.
- Scoped, planned and created documentation for 3 standalone desktop projects: Analyzer, Visualizer and Forecasting.
- Created Release Notes for users across multiple product version releases.
- Currently working on creating [user assistance](http://help.planifi.net/visualplanning/Content/Home.htm) for their new product [Visual Planning](https://www.planifi.net/visual-planning).
