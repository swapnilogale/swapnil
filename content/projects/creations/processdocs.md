### Context

NBN Co was established in 2009 to design, build and operate Australiaâ€™s wholesale broadband access network.

I was part of NBN's Hybrid Fibre Coaxial (HFC) Network Operations team, working with process analysts to support a large capability project across various Network teams.

### Opportunity
I was asked to unofficially lead a team of technical writers working on a large documentation project creating process docs and work instructions.
When we started as a group, there are no existing documents or knowledge to support process maps. Over a span of 18 months, we built a knowledge base of over 150 individual documents, supporting process maps across Change, Performance, Network and Service Incidents.

After creating these documents in MS Word, I led a project to convert these documents to an online format, using Atlassian Confluence, which led to an instant uptake in usage and accessibility.

### Contribution

Over the course of 2 years, I worked on:

- Planning, designing and writing process documentation and work instructions for multiple teams.
- Leading technical writing efforts across multiple network operation teams.
- Assisting project management of the content overhaul project from Word to Confluence. Designed mockups and set up testing.
