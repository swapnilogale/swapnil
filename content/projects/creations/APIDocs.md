### Context
SEEK is currently refreshing its API integration products for partners and hirers.

### Problem
The various SEEK teams are working on a single API built using GraphQL, OAuth 2.0 and optional webhooks. The Partner Integration team is also working on refreshing the onboarding experience for partners and hirers, to improve process efficiencies and streamline the self-serving nature of the process.

As part of this project, they required a **Technical Writer** to assist with redesigning the onboarding portal and review the developer portal content for consistency and accuracy. They also needed someone to refresh site taxonomy & information architecture.

### Contribution

I started with understanding the problem they were trying to solve, by talking to various stakeholders including Partner Integration team, Product Managers and Developers.

So far, I have:

- Completed a content audit of the existing onboarding and developer portals.
- Facilitated a card sorting exercise to identify key themes and groups.
- Created an Information Plan with mockups, content suggestions and plan to create content.
- Initiated a style guide to capture key decisions around content styles.
- Reviewed 3 key use cases of the SEEK API and edited these to make them clear to understand.
- Created authentication topics for partners to understand how to authenticate for using the SEEK API.
