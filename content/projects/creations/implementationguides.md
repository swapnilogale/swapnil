### Context

As a Technical Writer in the AWS Solutions Engineering team in the Australia, Pacific and Japan (APJ) region, my role was to collaborate with developers and solution builders to document our solutions for our customers. One of the first solutions I documented was the Automated Data Analytics on AWS solution.

The [Automated Data Analytics on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/automated-data-analytics-on-aws/) solution provides an end-to-end data platform for ingesting, transforming, managing and querying datasets. This helps analysts and business users manage and gain insights from data without deep technical experience using Amazon Web Services (AWS).

### Problem

The AWS Solutions Engineering team provided prescriptive architectural guidance to customers by publishing reference solutions for common business and technical problems.

As part of this, the team worked with a **Technical Writer** to assist with writing technical content. There was a need to take ownership, prioritize, collaborate on, and launch technical content along with the solution launch for AWS customers.

### Contribution

I started with understanding the problem statement from a customer viewpoint, reading any existing reference documentation and technical specifications. I worked with the Product Manager to understand the solution features, and worked backwards from the launch timelines to create a key documentation deliverable (Implementation guide) for the solution.

Over the course of the project, I:

- Wrote technical content for our solution features,
- Facilitated feedback from various stakeholders to improve the technical documentation,
- Contributed to, and influenced template improvements for the technical guides,
- Improved documentation experience across the solution, by reviewing and editing the user interface (UI) text, and
- Added value by deploying contextual help in the user interface.

### Impact

- Planned, took ownership, and managed various types of technical content around our soltuionss.
- Delivered a range of improvements to the existing documentation creation experience by facilitating and trialling out new tools.
