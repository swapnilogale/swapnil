### Summary

When Google announced the Season of Docs 2021, I led Redocly's effort on submitting a [proposal](https://redoc.ly/gsod/) for our open source projects, Redoc and OpenAPI cli. The proposal was accepted by Google, and we hired two technical writers to work on our products.

I currently manage the administrative part of the project on behalf of Redocly, and also assist and mentor the technical writers on contributing to our open source documentation.

### Project scope

- Work as a communication liaison between Google and Redocly on all matters related to Season of Docs 2021 program.
- Work with technical writers and the open source community around promotion, setting expectations and deliverables for the program.
- Mentor technical writers working on Redocly open-source projects (Redoc and OpenAPI cli)

### Key learnings and deliverables

I have previously been a participant in the [Google Season of Docs 2019](geonetwork.md), but this was an opportunity to mentor other technical writers working on open source documetnation.

_The project is still ongoing until November 2021_.

So far, in the last 2 months, I have been learning the ropes of:

- Understanding the project management side of open source documentation.
- Hiring, training and mentoring technical writers for the projects.
- Keeping open source documentation efforts sustainable over long term.
