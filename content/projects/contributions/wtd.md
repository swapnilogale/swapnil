### Context

[Write the Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/) is a global community of people who care about documentation. We consider everyone who cares about communication, documentation, and their users to be a member of our community. This can be programmers, tech writers, developer advocates, customer support, marketers, and anyone else who wants people to have great experiences with software.

### Contribution

While we have had other communities in Australia that covered technical documentation sporadically, there was no community for like- minded people to get together and talk about documentation issues. I have been part of other groups that organised technical writing events and conferences in the past, but in 2016, none of these groups existed and there was a serious gap in community events.

I initiated the [Write the Docs community in Australia](https://www.meetup.com/Write-the-Docs-Australia) in June 2016 and started organising meetup events around Australia, along with a lot of help from friends from my writing network. We started organising meetup events in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane from Sept 2016 and have so far have organised over 75 events across Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, and online.

In Nov 2017, I also organised the first [Write the Docs Australia day event](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/au/2017/) that included presentations and half a day of documentation sprints.

Over the last 8 years, I have chaired, and organised 5 conferences in [Melbourne](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2018/) and [Sydney](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2019/), and virtually (in 2020 and 2022) that have been attended by over 700 people and featured speakers from a large number of organisations, including from Australia, Europe, USA, India, Singapore and Vietnam.
