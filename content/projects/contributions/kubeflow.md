### Context

Google Kubeflow team organised a Kubeflow doc sprint in July 2019. A doc sprint is like a hackathon for docs. Over the course of three days, participants developed tutorials and fixed documentation bugs.

### Participation

I participated on Day 2 and helped document an overview topic on [using Jupyter notebooks in Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/notebooks/why-use-jupyter-notebook/).
